            "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. Historically, it has been a subject of fascination and intensive research since the mid-20th century, with the goal to develop software and systems that can perform tasks which would typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, recognizing speech, understanding languages, making decisions, and translating between languages. AI systems are now a part of our everyday lives, powering search engines, enabling voice assistants on smartphones, and automating industrial processes. Despite significant advances, AI technology continues to evolve, driven by greater computational power and more sophisticated algorithms. Researchers and developers are constantly exploring new ways to enhance the capabilities of AI, making it more efficient, reliable, and accessible to a broader audience.\n",
