* Heart Failure Prediction Analysis unig Power BI
    Insights:
   •	Using donut chart, we acquired that Male have most chances of getting heart disease than females.
   •	Using scatter plot, we acquired that as sum of age increases sum of old peak also increases with cholesterol.
   •	Using card, we found that the sum of Cholesterol is 182k, sum of Resting BP is 122k and sum of Heart Disease is 508.
   •	Using Gauge, we came know about the count of sum of Old Peak is 814.60
   •	Using Clustered Column chart, we acquired sum of Age, sum of Resting BP with Resting ECG which shows Normal Resting ECG have high Resting BP than ST-T wave 
        abnormality and LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria.
   •	Using Line and Clustered Column chart, we acquired that males have high Cholesterol, Resting BP than females.
   •	Using Funnel chart, we acquired 100% on sum of Resting BP, 380.65% on sum of Old Peak and 237.4% on Sum of Heart Disease.
